      "infoDetails": "Drinking dirty water can cause diseases such as cholera, typhoid and diarrhoea, which kills millions of people every year. In many parts of the world, women and children walk for hours across dangerous terrain in search of water. The water they are able to find is often dirty, carrying disease. Nobody should have to live like this. Help us make fresh, clean water accessible to everyone; According to the statistics, more than 2 million people in Bangladesh lack access to an improved water source whereas 36 million people don’t have access to proper sanitation system. The real number can be greater than this. It is sound to say that a significant amount of people are still struggling to get pure water. In several places flood visits every year for a certain period of time . Latrines overflow and contaminate water sources during these extreme events. In those areas, Water wells go remain under water for at least three to four months. To resolve this matter, Al Manahil welfare Foundation Bangladesh invented a new design so that the tube wells don’t go under water during the natural calamities. Al Manahil Welfare Foundation Bangladesh has been working to provide drinkable water to the people who don’t have an access to pure water. As a result, around Bangladesh we have constructed more than 10,000 shallow water wells and 1000 deep water wells. One of our main principal is to ensure pure water for the unprivileged people. Because prophet Muhammah (sm) once said that to give water is the best charity. And this one liner is the base of our organization. build a well with your donation today to save countless lives through our Water For Life appeal.",

Most of the mosques in Bangladesh run educational programs by which young lads get to know the beauty of islam. Not only that they also learn to read and write Arabic by these programs. Hence, Al Manahil Welfare Foundation Bangladesh tends to build mosques where it is necessary. By building a masjid one person not only earns the reward of providing a community with a house of Allah, but also ensures a permanent deal of sadaqah Jariyaah for himself. Till now, Al Manahil Welfare Foundation has constructed 700 mosques around Bangladesh. We always try to build mosque where there is not any and at least there would be 200 families. Analyzing all the factors, we start building a mosque in that place.",

There is no clear statistics of the number of the orphans that reside in Bangladesh. But it is safe to say that the number is not low at all. Al Manahil Welfare Foundation Bangladesh always tries to work for the betterment of the orphans. in 2022, under the supervision of Al Manahil Foundation, 800 students are receiving quality education spending without even a single penny. We always try to ensure a better life for the orphans. There are two reasons behind it. The first one is religious value which we have stated above. The second one is social welfare. An orphan is one of the most vulnerable people in the society. They tend to indulge themselves in criminal activities due to financial problems. We can see a lots of street children are taking drugs in daylight out of whom majority are orphans. So, we can see it would help the society as well, if we help the orphans. Al Manahil welfare Foundation Bangladesh has several projects which circles around orphans. We have a vision to educate thousands of orphans every year so that they can contribute to the society.",

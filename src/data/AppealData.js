In many parts of the world, women and children walk for hours across dangerous terrain in search of water. The water they are able to find is often dirty, carrying disease.

Help us make fresh, clean water accessible to everyone; According to the statistics, more than 2 million people in Bangladesh lack access to an improved water source whereas 36 million people don’t have access to proper sanitation system. The real number can be greater than this. It is sound to say that a significant amount of people are still struggling to get pure water. In several places flood visits every year for a certain period of time . Latrines overflow and contaminate water sources during these extreme events. In those areas, Water wells go remain under water for at least three to four months. To resolve this matter, Al Manahil welfare Foundation Bangladesh invented a new design so that the tube wells don’t go under water during the natural calamities. Al Manahil Welfare Foundation Bangladesh has been working to provide drinkable water to the people who don’t have an access to pure water. As a result, around Bangladesh we have constructed more than 10,000 shallow water wells and 1000 deep water wells. One of our main principal is to ensure pure water for the unprivileged people. Because prophet Muhammah (sm) once said that to give water is the best charity.

Most of the mosques in Bangladesh run educational programs by which young lads get to know the beauty of islam. Not only that they also learn to read and write Arabic by these programs. Hence, Al Manahil Welfare Foundation Bangladesh tends to build mosques where it is necessary. By building a masjid one person not only earns the reward of providing a community with a house of Allah, but also ensures a permanent deal of sadaqah Jariyaah for himself. Till now, Al Manahil Welfare Foundation has constructed 700 mosques around Bangladesh. We always try to build mosque where there is not any and at least there would be 200 families.

      "During the peak time of covid-19 pandemic, in the mid of April, 2020, Al Manahil covid-19 rescue team was providing free ambulance service to a covid patient. The team spent whole night going one hospital to another hospital to get a seat for that patient. But, unfortunately, each and every seat was filled with patient. We could not manage a single seat for that patient as even a single one was not vacant. That patient died in the morning. Since then, we started our preparation to start a fully dedicated hospital for the unprivileged people. As a result, by the grace of almighty, One woman agreed to provide us a land with 5 storey building to establish a hospital. Thus, we have started the journey of ‘Al Manahil Nurture General hospital’ which till now served more than 5000 patients. This hospital is being an example for the maternity department as we focus on good behavior along with best medical facilities for mothers and new borne children.",

      "The first covid-19 infected patient in Bangladesh was detected on 8th March, 2020. It was a scary situation. With deaths due to Covid-19 rising in Bangladesh, bereaved families are facing yet another grim reality -- not being able to bury their loved ones with full rituals due to the fear of exposing themselves to the virus. In many cases, families and community members have not been able to attend the funeral prayers either because of physical distancing measures or due to fear of the infection. Amid such uncertainties, Al Manahil Welfare Foundation Bangladesh formed a team which started providing funeral services and free ambulance services. Nowadays Al Manahil Covid-19 rescue team provides their ambulance and funeral services to those people who cannot afford due to the financial crisis. Till August 2022, Al Manahil COvid 19 rescue team facilitated 3784 people with ambulance service whereas provided funeral services to more than 3000 dead body.",
